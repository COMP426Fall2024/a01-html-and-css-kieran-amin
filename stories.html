    <h2>The Contest for Athens</h2>
    <p>
      The first king of Athens, King Cecrops, set out to find a patron deity for
      his city state. He called upon both Poseidon and Athena, whose intense
      rivalry nearly led to a war so Athena wisely suggested a peaceful contest
      instead of a war. The two gods would each give the city a gift and the
      people would choose the winner. Poseidon struck the ground with his
      trident and produced a water spring. To the people's dismay, the water was
      salty as Poseidon channeled this water from the sea. Athena planted an
      olive tree that grew to provide olives for the city, oil for cooking and
      lamps, and wood for buildig boats and houses. Thus, Athena was declared
      the victor and the city was named Athens.

    <h2>Creating the Horse</h2>
    <p>
      The legend states that Poseidon fell in love with the Goddess Demeter and
      to impress her, he wanted to create the most beautiful creature for her.
      He worked for some time and was able to create the horse. However, he had
      taken so long to make the horse, that he was no longer in love with
      Demeter. He gave the horse to the humans and they were able to use it for
      racing, transportation and farming.
