    <h2>About Poseidon</h2>
    <p>
      Poseidon is the Greek god of the sea, earthquakes, and horses. As one of
      the twelve Olympian deities, he is a powerful and unpredictable force,
      often depicted wielding a trident. Poseidon is the brother of Zeus and
      Hades, and he rules over all waters, making him a vital figure for sailors
      and seafarers. Sailors would pray to Poseidon for good fortune before
      setting voyage. Known for his volatile temper, he could both calm the seas
      or unleash devastating storms and tsunamis. In mythology, he is often
      associated with horses, believed to have created them, and he fathered
      many mythical creatures, including the winged horse Pegasus.
    </p>
    <h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>
    <p>
      Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, wields immense powers over water,
      storms, and natural disasters. As the ruler of the ocean, he can control
      all bodies of water, causing calm seas or unleashing powerful waves and
      storms. His primary weapon, the trident, grants him the ability to create
      earthquakes, tsunamis, and floods. Poseidon is also associated with horses
      and is said to have created them, further showcasing his connection to
      both land and sea. His dominion over marine creatures and the oceanic
      depths makes him one of the most powerful and unpredictable Olympian gods.
    </p>
    <h2>Mythological Stories</h2>
    <p>
      Poseidon features prominently in several mythological stories that
      highlight his power, temper, and complex relationships with gods and
      mortals alike. See the Stories page for specific tales.
